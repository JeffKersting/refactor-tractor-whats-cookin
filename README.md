# Refactor Tractor: What's Cookin'?

Do you like eating?  If so, try cooking. And we can help!

Our site, 'What's Cookin'?', displays a variety of recipes to tempt your taste-buds. A user is free to:
 - puruse the recipes
 - search recipes by keyword
 - search recipes by types/tags
 - add interesting recipes to a list of recipes 'to cook'
 - add tasty recipes to a list of recipe 'favorites'
 - keep track of ingredients in a 'pantry'
 - search for ingredients in the 'pantry'
 - add ingredients to the 'pantry'
 - see what recipes can be made using exisiting 'pantry' ingredients
 - for each recipe, see which ingredients are missing from the 'pantry'
 - 'cook' a recipe, and see the pantry amounts reflect the ingredients used
 - display the cost of the recipes with very real and accurate prices

This is a group project for [Turing School](https://turing.io/) in Module 2, which introduced us to working with pre-existing code in preparation for any legacy codebases we may work with in the future. 

We recieved some existing code and were able to refactor and build out the functionality, with emphasis on DRY logic and accessibility, as well as using dynamic fetch requests to API endpoints to reflect a strong data model.
## Setup

//DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS:
If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.

Visit the site at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Otherwise, in order to deploy this site locally, a user will have to run a local server.

  1. Clone (or fork and then clone) this repo with  `git clone git@github.com:JeffKersting/refactor-tractor-whats-cookin.git [what you want to name the repo]`
  2. Change into the directory and run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
  3. Run `npm start` to start a local server 
  4. To access the site in your browser, navigate to the localhost address that your terminal gives you. 
  5. For any of the class tests, run ```npm test [name of the test you want to run]``` 
  6. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Contributors

[This project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-2/refactor-tractor-wc.html) was used exisiting code from previous students and staff at [Turing School Staff](https://turing.io/)

This refactor was coded by [Jeff Kersting](https://github.com/JeffKersting), [Allison Dietz](https://github.com/dietza), [Thao Ma](https://github.com/thaomonster) and [Alice Ruppert](https://github.com/srslie).

Special thanks to our mentors [Scott Schipke](https://github.com/sschipke)

## Technologies

During this project we gained experience with the following technologies:
- ES6 JavaScript
- Testing with Mocha and Chai
- Linting with ESLint
- Semantic HTML
- Responsive SCSS with Media Queries
- Wave, ColorBlind, and ARIA Accessibility
- Using network requests with API endpoints and async JavaScript
- Using Webpack to compile mulitple class and script files
- Deploying a site on GitHub Pages
- Git workflow using GitHub Issues and Project Kanban Board

We also gained invaluable experience working with a larger group (4 people) and collaborating on exisiting data.
## Future Iterations

This project helped us practice familiarizing ourselves with exisiting code, working asynchronously with three others a project in a relatively short time-frame, and honed our planning, communication and project managament.

However, if time permitted, we would've loved to accomplish more. 

While no future work is planned on this project, we kept in mind ideas for building this out for further functionality.
